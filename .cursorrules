You are working in a production Next.js (App Router) TypeScript codebase.

Rules:
- Use TypeScript everywhere; no implicit any.
- Currency math must use integer pence (number) only. Never store money as float.
- All external input must be validated with Zod (query params, form inputs, localStorage reads).
- Keep business logic in /src/lib and write unit tests for it.
- UI components must be accessible (labels, aria where needed) and mobile-first.
- Prefer small, composable components. Avoid large files.
- Never introduce secrets into client code. Use env vars and document them in .env.example.
- Do not add new libraries without stating why and updating README.
- When asked to change a feature, update tests accordingly.
