# Frontend Conventions

## Components
- Client components: "use client" when needed (hooks, events)
- Prefer server components by default
- Colocate styles; use Tailwind

## State
- LocalStorage for anonymous users (key: penny-challenge-settings)
- Session for auth; use `useSession()` from next-auth/react

## API
- Fetch /api/save (POST), /api/saved (GET) when authenticated
- Handle 401, 429, 500 gracefully
